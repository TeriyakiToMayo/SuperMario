A hypothetical change to the game would be adding a coin sprite to the HUD. Given the class, adding a 
coin object would be relatively simple as only the location would need to be set and the coin counter
location may need to be moved slightly. While the class has high coupling as it has many dependencies,
the class itself is very cohesive as everything in the class has to do with the HUD and getting the 
necessary data for it. One recommendation for the class would be to make the string literals constants
at the beginning of the class.
