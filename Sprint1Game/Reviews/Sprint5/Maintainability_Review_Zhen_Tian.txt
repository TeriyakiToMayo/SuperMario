Specific comments on code quality:
The SoundManager.cs uses no concrete classes of the project, hence its coupling is loose. At the 
same time, SoundManager.cs only focuses on stroing sound tracks used in the game and relative methods 
such as PlayOverWorldSong(), therefore it is a high cohesion design. 

Hypothetical change to:
The SoundManager.cs is very easy and convenient to extend. For instance, if the team needs another 
soundeffect or another background music, only a new field which stores the sound and a method to 
play the sound are needed.
