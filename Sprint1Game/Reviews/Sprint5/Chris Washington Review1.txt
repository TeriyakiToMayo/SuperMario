The HeadsUpDisplayPanel is very readable.  It is a focused class, that only has one real job.
It creates and draws the sprites to the screen. It was smart to have the text me updated from 
a different class. Also the fix text method was a good idea for making sure the certain text 
were written in the correct format that the actual orignal Mario game had.
