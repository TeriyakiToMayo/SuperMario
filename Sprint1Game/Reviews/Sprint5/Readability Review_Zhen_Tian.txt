What is readable and what is not:
All variable names and method names of SoundManager are in correct style and are easy for others to 
understand. The only problem of SoundManager is that the type of both overworldSound and underworldSound
are "Song", and other ones are "SoundEffect". It might be better to use overworldMusic instead of overworldSound 
because this name can indicate that it is a piece of background music not a sound effect.
