Specific comments on code quality:
There are two problems in the Spawner.cs. Firstly, it has tight coupling with other concrete classes 
such as Goomba2.cs, Koopa2.cs and Horse.cs. In order to solve this problem, there should be an 
enemy factory so that Spawner does not need to use concrete constructors of those enemy objects. 
Secondly, it has high cyclomatic complexity. There are several if statements and one switch statement, 
which dramatically increases the complexity. Overall, the Spawner.cs has high cohesion since it 
is only responsible for spawning enemies, however, it has tight coupling with other classes and 
complex logic structure.

Hypothetical change to:
The Spawner.cs is easy to extend. If the team is in need of a new type of enemy to spawn, what the 
team needs to do is to add a new branch to switch statement in "SpawnEnemy" method and no other 
part is needed to change.
