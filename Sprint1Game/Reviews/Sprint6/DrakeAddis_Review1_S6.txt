Specific comments on what is readable and what is not: Overall, the class is very simple to understand.  The logic behind
	what is occuring is simple enough that the in-line comment should be removed. The code is a little confusing at parts 
	but after examing the code it is not to hard to understand what is going on. The only suggestion I have would
	be to remove the comment to make the code even cleaner.
