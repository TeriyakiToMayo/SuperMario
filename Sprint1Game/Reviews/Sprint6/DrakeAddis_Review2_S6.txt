Specific comments on code quality: Overall the quality has improved and the in-line comment has been removed.  The code is 
	still a little confusing but this is understandable due to the logic behind it. It is still easily readable and
	understandable though.
A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and 
how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change: One change that is strongly recommended 
	would be to remove the magic numbers for the amount of enemies and make use of the utility classes. This would help 
	the game's maintainability in the long run and it would be very easy to implement.
