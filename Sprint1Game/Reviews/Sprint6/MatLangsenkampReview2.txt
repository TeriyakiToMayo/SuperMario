Sprint number: 5

Number of minutes taken to complete the review: 9

Specific comments on code quality: The code is properly indented and formatted. The methods are short with the exception 
of instances in which long switch statements are necessary. Some methods start to get deep in terms of nesting but nothing that isnt managable

A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the 
current implementation could or could not easily support that change: Refactoring the long switch statements into other methods to reduced nesting
