Sprint 2 Refactored Implementation

CoinSprite.cs

Review time: 10 minutes
I think the code exhibits high cohesion since it is focused on only maintaining the coin sprite.
Having all constants in the ItemSpriteFactory make maintainability easier with the single point
of control. 
A change that the class might need to handle is for a moving coin. The class would need to be 
able to handle a change in the destination rectangle, which I do not think with this code it 
would be difficult to implement, as it would just be adjusting the y-value of the destination.
