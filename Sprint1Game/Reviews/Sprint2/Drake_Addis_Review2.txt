Sprint number: 2
Name of the .cs file being reviewed: KeyboardController.cs and Commands within Commands folder
Author of the .cs file being reviewed: Matt Langsenkamp
Specific comments on code quality: The syntax looks good and the KeyboardController applies only to pressed keys
	so it has high cohesion.  The commands are very straight-forward and are extremely simple.
A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and 
how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change: The spacing in some of the commands
	could be shortened a bit but other than that it looks good.  The code is very simple and doesn't have anything
	that is unnecessary or that could be changed.
