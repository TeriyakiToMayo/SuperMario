Readiblity:
Drake constantly conforms to a good naming convention in these files. All class members and 
parameters are in Camel Casing style while the names of classes, properties and methods are 
in Pascal style. The names of the variables and methods are clear and easy to understand. 

Flexitiblity to Hypothetical Change:
The implementations are in good practice and easy to extend. For instance, if a fly mode is 
needed for Koopa, what Drake needs to do is simply to add a boolean variable named "isFlying" 
to indicated the state of koopa and add a Koopa flying sprite in the KoopaStateMachine.cs. 
And then only some minor changes in the statemachine are needed for the state transitions.
