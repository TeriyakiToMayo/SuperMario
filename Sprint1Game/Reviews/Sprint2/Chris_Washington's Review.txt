Review:
Good use of variable names.  Also it is easy for me to understand your code and what you are trying to do.  The only thing that might 
be confusing, to someone that does not know what you are trying to do, is the update method.  It takes a little bit to understand what you are
doing, but when I had you explain it to me it made perfect sense.  I ended up using your logic to implement my animated coin sprite.
