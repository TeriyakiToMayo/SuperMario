Date of the code review: 2/13/2017

Sprint number: 2

Name of the .cs file being reviewed: MarioSprite.cs, all .cs files in "States" folder

Author of the .cs file being reviewed: Nic Siebenaller

Specific comments on code quality: All of the state classes are well thought out and
appear to be easily maintainable. The mario class is also concise and well though out. Fields 
are private and there are no methods that exist that do not need to.
for fields that need to be accessed outside of the class properties exist. 

A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the 
current implementation could or could not easily support that change: 
The properties could be above the method constructor for the state classes in some of the stateclasses that it is not.
potentially the states classes could have inherited from a state baseclass that contained the
constants.
