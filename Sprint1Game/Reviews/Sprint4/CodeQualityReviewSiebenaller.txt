Sprint 4 Refactored Implementation

RMushroomBlockCollisionTop.cs
Chris Washington
Review time: 10 minutes
A hypothetical change that could be made to the game is getting the red mushroom to bounce after a
collision with the top of block. This command would need to be changed because the velocity and 
loaction of the mushroom are changed. While the checks for type are necessary given the general 
collision handler we have implemented in the game, the command should only make a call to what 
should be done rather than doing it in the class itself. The current method has higher coupling 
than what would allow for the hypothetical change described above.
