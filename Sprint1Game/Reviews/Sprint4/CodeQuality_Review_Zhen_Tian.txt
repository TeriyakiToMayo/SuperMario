Specific comments on code quality:
Camera2D.cs is a high cohesion and loose coupling design. The class only focuses basic functionalities 
of camera such as changing position based on mario's moving and transforming the graphics. The 
class uses interfaces to interact with other objects, for example, IMario. It does not use any 
of other concrete classes which dramatically reduces its coupling. Overall, Camera2D.cs has high 
code quality. 

Hypothetical change to:
Camera2D.cs is easy to extend. For instance, if the team needs to implement a transport object, 
the taem only needs to implement a new method to assign new position of camera and make minor 
changes to other variables.
