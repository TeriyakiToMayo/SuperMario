Specific comments on code quality: Overall the quality of code is excellent.  It is easy to read, follow, and understand.
	There is however one commented line of code which should be removed.
A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and 
how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change: I would suggest changing the Update method a bit.
	It looks as though some of the if statements could be avoided/combined to shorten code.  This could be easily implemented
	by simply removing the if statement if deemed unnecessary and moving around the code to make it work seamlessly.
