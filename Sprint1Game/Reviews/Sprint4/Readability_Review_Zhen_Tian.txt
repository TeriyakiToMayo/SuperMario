What is readable and what is not:
The field names of Camera2D.cs are easy to understand. However, the casing of 
public static variable "cameraX" should be in Pascal style. The names of methods 
of Camera2D.cs are in correct style but some of them are not easy to understand. 
For instance, method "Move" is kind of confusing.
