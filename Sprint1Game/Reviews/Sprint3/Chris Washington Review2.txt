Review:  I thought what you did was a gret way to efficiently implement the testing.  Even though the class is long
that is okay, because there are a lot of test cases.  For all the test cases that needed to be checked the class is
actually not that long.  Also the code seems easily maintainable.  The only think that you will have to add are cases 
for when we need to implement collision testing for the items colliding with enemies and visa versa.  Also for the enemies 
and items to collide with blocks or pipes.
