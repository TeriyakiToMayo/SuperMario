Code Quality:
The GameObjectManager class is well designed. It exhibits a high cohesion because it only 
focuses on initializing all game objects. At the same time, it uses all interfaces to handle 
the game objects, which is a loose coupling design. The only problem is that the it might 
need a list to handle all controllers instead of updating them manually. 

Flexitiblity to Hypothetical Change:
The GameObjectManager class is flexible to changes and easy to extend. When the team needs a 
new type of game objects, the team only needs to add a new list variable and add new methods 
corresponding to it without changing other parts of the class.
