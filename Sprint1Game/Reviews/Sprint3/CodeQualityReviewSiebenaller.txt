Sprint 3 Refactored Implementation

MarioRMushroomCollisionTop.cs

Review time: 5 minutes
A hypothetical change that could be made to the game is creating a transition form when Mario
collects the mushroom to changing size. This command would be unaffected because calling the method
mario.State.ChangeToBig() will handle the transition ideally so this piece of code would not need
to be modified at all. The code only relies on the objects being passed in the order that is 
expected, so the client code calling this needs to be aware of this, which my not make it as robust, 
but without being able to cast the objects to a certain type an if-else structure would need to be
used increasing cyclomatic complexity, but this benefit comes at the cost of needing to now more 
implementation details in order to use the method. This is not the fault of the author of this
class but rather the design of the game.
