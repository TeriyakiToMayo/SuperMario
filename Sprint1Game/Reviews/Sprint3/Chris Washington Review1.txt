Specific comments on what is readable and what is not: Understand the beinging of the class and it is easy to read, your are just creating 
the star mario sprite for a big mario.  The rest of your code is still readable, but logically I do not understand why you need to have the other
methods in this class that change the state of Mario.  Shouldn't this be handled outside of this specific class? I could be wrong though.
