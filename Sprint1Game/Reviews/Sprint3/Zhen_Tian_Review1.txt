What is readable and what is not:
The names of fields and properties in CSVWriter.cs are easy to understand and are in 
correct styles of casing. However, the casing of the name of method writeObject() is not 
correct, which should be WriteObject(). Additionally, the parameters of writeObject() 
"x", "y" and "s" are not easy to understand. To improve this, using "objectCode" instead 
of "s" might be a good choice.
