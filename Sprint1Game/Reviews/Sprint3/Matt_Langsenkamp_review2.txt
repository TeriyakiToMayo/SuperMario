Sprint number: 3

Name of the .cs file being reviewed: AllCollisionHandler.cs, CollisionSide.cs, CollisionXMLParser

Author of the .cs file being reviewed: Nic Siebenaller

Specific comments on code quality: AllCollisionHandler has some if statements that are nested three deep, however their is not much that could be 
done in the way of making this code more modular. With the exception of one method (DetermineCollisionSide) all methods are short and concise.
The code itself is well indented and easy to read. With the passable exception of the rectangle class coupling is low.

A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the 
current implementation could or could not easily support that change: in the DetermineCollisionSide method the lines 59 - 73 and 77 - 92 could be refactored into their own methods 
to reduce the length of the statement. Naming these mathods would also give a clearer indication of what they do.
