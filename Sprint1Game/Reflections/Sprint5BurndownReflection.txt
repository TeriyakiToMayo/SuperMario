Team 5 
Burndown Chart Assessment
Sprint 5

The bump returned for this sprint due to the majority of the work being done in the last few days. Additionally, members
tend not to update the time as they are progressing so there are sudden drops whenever something is completed. The next 
sprint will have more time associated with planning, so the trend should be better as more stuff will be done at the 
beginning of the sprint. The automated reminders continue to help the group also.
