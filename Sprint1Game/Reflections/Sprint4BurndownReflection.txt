Team 5 
Burndown Chart Assessment
Sprint 4

For this sprite we did a better job managing the burndown chart compared to the previous sprites.  We over estimated how much time 
would be needed for many of the task which resulted in a few humps in our brndown chart.  There is a L shape in our burndown chart, but this 
is due to the fact that we had spring break during this sprite and not much work was done during spring break.  Therefore, the L shpae 
is no need for concern.  Overall we did a good job getting our backlog assignments finshed in an appropiate time.
