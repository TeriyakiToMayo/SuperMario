Team 5 
Burndown Chart Assessment
Sprint 6

The group did a poor job managing the burndown chart. I think the automated messages were
being ignored more and people worked on it mostly several days before. We still did a poor
job updating our times, but I think we will rise up and improve on our next Sprint 7.
