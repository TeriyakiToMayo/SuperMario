Team 5 
Burndown Chart Assessment
Sprint 3

We got together to plan for the initial implementation for this Sprint later than we should have so that is partially why
there is an increase in the middle of the chart. The other reasons is that times were not fully updated after we met to 
plan for Sprint 3. Not everything for the initial implementation was met on time either. We were so focused on getting
the game to work the burndown chart was not properly updated. For Sprint 4, we need to put more emphasis on planning and
crafting a design that will hit all the necessary specifications. Automated reminders to update the backlog could be useful
so the burndown chart is properly maintained.
