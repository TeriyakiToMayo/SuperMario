The team should have assigned backlogs earlier. The team also should have been more dilleigent about updating backlogs as they 
were completed. Overall the burndown trend was decent and the work was completed over time as opposed to in large clumps. The team 
divided up the work relatively evenly and there were no large discrepencies in workload.
